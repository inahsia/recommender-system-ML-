# Basic Recommender System Using Machine Learning (KNN)
This project demonstrates a basic recommender system built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a popular supervised machine learning technique. The system is integrated with Gradio, a user-friendly library for building interactive web interfaces, to allow users to visualize and interact with recommendations in real-time.

Features
Supervised Learning Algorithm: Implements the KNN algorithm for recommendation.
Interactive Interface: Powered by Gradio, enabling users to explore recommendations seamlessly.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to different datasets or recommendation scenarios.
Beginner-Friendly: A great starting point for anyone interested in building recommender systems.
Dataset
This project uses a sample dataset of items (movies, books, products, etc.) and user preferences. The data is preprocessed to create a user-item matrix that the KNN algorithm uses to find similar users/items for generating recommendations.

How It Works
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is cleaned and transformed into a user-item matrix.
Sparse representations are used to optimize the KNN calculations.
Recommendation Generation:

The KNN algorithm identifies similar users/items based on the distance metric (e.g., cosine similarity or Euclidean distance).
Top-N recommendations are generated for each user or item.
Interactive Results:

Gradio provides an interactive interface where users can input their preferences and view personalized recommendations.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Algorithm for finding similar users/items.
Gradio: Library for creating the interactive user interface.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: Implementation of the KNN algorithm.
